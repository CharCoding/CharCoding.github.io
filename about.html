  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Long story short, my friend over at Columbia University had his own webpage and it looked cool, so I decided to make my own. The source can be found on <a href="https://github.com/CharCoding/CharCoding.github.io/">GitHub</a>. Everything on here is under the MIT Lisence.</p>
  <p>This site contains absolutely no tracking, no ads, no cookies, no cryptominers or anything like that.</p>
  <p>I could talk pages about myself but that would just be weird. Instead, all you need to know is that I'm a student at the U of M studying math and compsci, and somehow have a little bit of time to make side projects like this.</p>
  <p>My other friend at Cambridge University often collaborate with me on some projects. We're basically a bunch of nerds that code and play board games.</p>
  <p>Hopefully you found this place interesting. I might add stuff here from time to time but don't expect much.</p>
  <p>P.S. There may or may not be easter eggs scattered around my website. Look around...</p>
